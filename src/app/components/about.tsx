                <p className="text-neutral-700 pb-6">My name is <b>Alex Domzalski</b>. I am a web developer, musician, and bird enthusiast.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been a freelance full-stack developer for roughly four years now, and building fun websites is something very dear to me. The tech stack I&#39;ve found myself gravitating towards most has been <b>React</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, <b>Node</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, and <b>Tailwind</b>. Other technologies I&#39;ve been messing around with have been <b>HTMX/Golang</b> and <b>React Native/SQLite</b>.<br></br><br></br>When not building websites, I am a touring and session bassist who regularly performs with and records for bluegrass artist Canon Tyler. You can find information about live performances and new releases on his <a className="hover:underline text-blue-500" href="https://www.instagram.com/canontylermusic/" target="_blank"><b>Instagram</b></a>.<br /><br />If you&#39;d like to discuss work, tech, music, birds, or if you want recommendations for <i>excellent places to visit in Tokyo or northern Japan</i>, please don&#39;t hesitate to <a className="hover:underline text-blue-500" href="mailto:hello@alexdomzalski.com"><b>send me an email</b></a>!</p>
